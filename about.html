            I'm in the game to defend. Not just playing around – I'm building real skills 
            to protect systems, hunt threats, and shut down attacks before they hit. 
            Blue Team is where I'm at, and I'm here to stay.

            Currently grinding through <strong>HTB Academy</strong> and <strong>Google Cybersecurity Certificate</strong>. 
            Every day is a chance to level up, learn new techniques, and get better at what I do. 
            The learning never stops – that's the only way to stay ahead of the threats.

        <p class="about-text">
            To understand how to defend, you gotta know how to attack. That's why I dive deep into 
            reverse engineering and malware analysis – to see what the bad guys are doing, 
            then build defenses that can stop them. It's a constant battle, but that's what makes it real.
